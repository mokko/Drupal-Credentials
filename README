NAME
    Drupal::Credentials - Access credentials (user, pass etc.) from Drupal's
    sites directory (settings.php)

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    Access info from Drupal's $db_uri contained in settings.php

        use Drupal::Credentials;

        my $credentials = Drupal::Credentials->new($site_dir);
            $credentials->parse_sites_dir

            my @sites=$credentials->get_sites;

            foreach my $site_id ($sites) {
                    my $dbstring=$credentials->get_dbstring($site_id);
                    my $proto=$credentials->get_scheme($site_id);
                    my $passw=$credentials->get_pass($site_id);
                    my $db=$credentials->get_database($site_id);
                    my $host=$credentials->get_host($site_id);
                    my $user=$credentials->get_user($site_id);
            }
            my $sites_dir=$credentials->get_sites_dir;

METHODS
  my $credentials = Drupal::Credentials->new($site_dir);
    $site_dir is the drupal/sites

    Returns 1 on success and nothing on failure.

  $credentials->parse_sites_dir
    Reads the directory specified as sites_dir during new, and looks for
    subdirectories which a setting.php file in them. Settings.php file is
    searched for $db_url from which the credentials are extracted.

  my $host=$credentials->get_host($site_id);
    Return host from credentials.

  my $pw=$credentials->get_pass($site_id);
    Return pass from credentials for site with $site_id.

  my $proto=$credentials->get_scheme($site_id);
    Return scheme from credentials for site with $site_id.

  my $un=$credentials->get_user($site_id);
    Return user from credentials for site with $site_id.

  my $db=$credentials->get_database($site_id);
    Return database from credentials for site with $site_id.

  my $dbstring=$credentials->get_dbstring($site_id);
    Return string from settings.php's $db_uri for site with $site_id. This
    one will not be unescaped, if it uses hex encoding (e.g. %2a for :). I
    suspect that this method is not of real use except for debugging.

  my @sites=$credentials->get_sites;
    Return site ids in an array. A site id is the name of the directory in
    sites directory, e.g. exampledomain.com

    (In code site id is sometimes referred to as site name.)

  my $sites_dir=$credentials->get_sites_dir;
    Return Drupal's path for site as specified during new.
